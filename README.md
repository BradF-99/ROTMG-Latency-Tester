# ROTMG-Latency-Tester
Tests jitter and ping to ROTMG game servers.

I wrote this to try WPF, and have decided I dislike it, meaning that I probably won't be making much, if any, changes to this program. Therefore, it will stay in this disgustingly-written state for the rest of time. 

All it does is grab the same file that the game downloads on launch (which contains the server details), and pings the IP addresses of each server, measuring ping and jitter. That's it.

## Things you need

* **[.NET Framework 4.5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net40)** (preferably the latest version of the framework)
* A copy of the game might help also.
